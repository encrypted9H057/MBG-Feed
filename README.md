# MBG-Feed
Sample application to demonstrate navigation, presentation and code style.

The correct usage of AWS is described here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/setup.html

Splash screen issue: The image on our splash screen may appear all black as if missing. There has been a bug filed (https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/17146) and the workaround does not always work. You may see Luke in his landspeeder as that's the image I'm swapping with that sometime makes the bug go away :/
